# Tasklet
Tasklet is an iOS app, built with Swift. I built this app to learn iOS mobile development.

In Tasklet, users can create posts (which could be jobs, volunteer opportunities, etc) for others to see. Users can go through the listings and pick something they like. Users are also able to chat through real-time messaging.

I am using Swift, SwiftUI, and Firebase.
